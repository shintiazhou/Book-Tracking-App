Note: The book API has limited request, if error occurred please wait for a while

code gets deployed to the NEAR blockchain when you run `yarn deploy:contract`. This sort of code-that-runs-on-a-blockchain is called a "smart contract"

Both contract and client-side code will auto-reload as you change source files.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!
