## Book Tracking App

## Development Mode

code gets deployed to the NEAR blockchain when you run `yarn deploy:contract`. This sort of code-that-runs-on-a-blockchain is called a "smart contract"

Both contract and client-side code will auto-reload as you change source files.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

### npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.
