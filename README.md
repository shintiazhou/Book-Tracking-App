## Book Tracking App

[View Live Demo](https://book-tracking-sz.netlify.app/)

Note: The book API has limited request, if error occurred please wait for a while

## Development Mode

code gets deployed to the NEAR blockchain when you run `yarn deploy:contract`. This sort of code-that-runs-on-a-blockchain is called a "smart contract"

Both contract and client-side code will auto-reload as you change source files.

## Production Mode

Build has problems (no override and no default toolchain set)

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

### npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.
